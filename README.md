# CRUD-Operation-Using-Java-and-Mysql

ðŸš€ Building a GUI-Based CRUD Application in Java with MySQL ðŸŽ¯

I recently built a GUI-based CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using Java Swing, JDBC, and MySQL. This project allows users to store, update, delete, and view student records in a MySQL database through a simple and intuitive interface.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack Used:
âœ… Java (Swing for GUI)
âœ… MySQL (Database)
âœ… JDBC (Database Connectivity)

ðŸ”¹ Key Features:
ðŸ”¹ Connects to MySQL database using JDBC
ðŸ”¹ Uses JTable to display and manage student data dynamically
ðŸ”¹ Validations to ensure correct data input (e.g., marks range check)
ðŸ”¹ Mouse click event to fetch and edit selected records
ðŸ”¹ Pop-up messages for user feedback

ðŸ”¹ What I Learned:
âœ¨ Handling Prepared Statements securely to prevent SQL injection
âœ¨ Implementing JTable with DefaultTableModel for real-time data updates
âœ¨ Working with Swing components for building an interactive UI
âœ¨ Applying good programming practices to manage database connections efficiently

ðŸš€ This project was a great way to strengthen my JDBC and GUI development skills. Looking forward to enhancing it with Hibernate for ORM and adding more features!

ðŸ“Œ Code Snippet:
// Connecting to MySQL Database  
String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/crudopp";  
String username = "root";  
String password = "1234";  
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
Would love to hear your thoughts! Drop a comment if you have any suggestions or if you're working on a similar project. ðŸ”¥
